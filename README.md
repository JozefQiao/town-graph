# Town Graph

## Introduction
The Town Graph project is a software application that represents a graph of a town's road network. It allows users to perform various operations on the graph, such as adding new roads, finding the shortest path between two locations, and calculating the total distance of a given route.

## Features
- **Graph Representation**: The application uses an adjacency list to represent the town's road network.
- **Add Roads**: Users can add new roads to the graph by specifying the source and destination locations, as well as the distance between them.
- **Shortest Path**: The application provides a function to find the shortest path between two locations in the town.
- **Calculate Distance**: Users can calculate the total distance of a given route by providing a sequence of locations.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Town Graph project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies: `pnpm install` or `npm install`
2. Run the application: `pnpm start` or `npm start`
